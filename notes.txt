Webpack

You will need to set-up webpack in your application:

1. Install 'webpack' and 'webpack-cli' - `npm install webpack webpack-cli`
2. Create a webpack config file - webpack.config.js
3. Add the configuration details to the config file
4. Add a script to the package.json to run webpack in watch mode - `"build": "webpack -w"`
5. Add a script tag to link to the bundled file in the HTML - `<script type="text/javascript" src="js/bundle.js"></script>`
6. Run webpack - `npm run build`
7. Check the log that shows the JavaScript has loaded is showing in the browser console.
8. Add `bundle.js` to a .gitignore file
